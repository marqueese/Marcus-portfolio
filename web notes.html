<strong>moral and ethical issues:</strong><br><br>
use of "cookies" to gather data from you, but this can also be used to upload viruses to your device.<br>
Terms & conditions are also a big problem as they contain so much, its skipped and they can do whatever you agree too.<br>
Observational techniques: obvserving abnormal behaviour, checking in on colleagues, noticing unexplainable injuries. etc.<br>

<br><Strong>ethical and moral issues in the workplace</strong><br><br>
automation is taking work from people as it is faster and much more efficient<br>


<br><strong>CA3 practice questions:<br>structure<br>What?<br>How?<br>Why?</strong><br>

<p class = "solid">Question 1:<br>
a gym wants to use the internet of things to track members activity, how could this be done  (3)
A gym can use and internet of things to track member activity by connecting all of the devices they use,<br>
to the same network and whilst the users devices connect to the network they can monitor the ammount of time spent<br>
on machines and continuously add them until they have disconnected from the network<br>
near field communications, bluetooth connection - trackers could be installed to monitor which machines are being used more often <br>
they could use the data gathered to work out which machines are used the most, and then add more of those machines to increase the ammount of time people will spend in the gym <br><br>

<p class = "solid">Question 2:<br>
what are the potential moral and ethical issues of requiring high  power computers to run every day applications  (4)<br>
High powered computers could have negative effects on daily use for many reasons, but i think one of the most negative effects would be the cost to run it<br>
as many homeowners know the cost of power is increasign a high powered comupter can have extremely negative effects<br>
The daily use of a high power computer will give you much faster performance although the drastic increase in cost to run is not worth it<br>
The only homeowners that should be using these for daily conventional use must be very wealth as the majority of the population<br>
could not afford to run these as often as they would a standard computer<br>


<p class = "solid">Question 3:<br>
Discuss the effect that the increasing use of VR could/ will have on society  (9)<br>

The increasing use of VR on society will have both positive and negative effects on society, and the negatives far outweigh the positives.<br>
A positive effect on an inreasing use of VR in society will mean it would likely reach schools at one point, and will make learning much more entertaining for children <br>
and very likely increase the chances of them taking in information, as it could be used as incentive to do better, whilst also being a fun experience.<br>
However the chances of VR reaching schools would be unlikely as the cost of Virtual Reality is still too high to everyday use.<br>

<br>A negative effect of Virtual reality in society can also be linked to schools,<br>
because the effectiveness of Virtual Reality will make learning far more intriguing and it does not require the cost of a teacher to be present<br>
if schools were to cut back on ammount of teachers and use the saved money to purchase Virtual Reality equiptment they could use this,<br>
to teach children about any subject in far greater detail, for example they could be shown in great detail a variety of things, things which<br>
no textbook could even come close to the ammount children could learn and this could become a reality, and put tens of thousands of teachers out of jobs <br>
simply because they can keep up with technology.<br>
