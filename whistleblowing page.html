whistleblowing examples<br><br>

<p class="solid"</p>Haugen stated: "The thing I saw at Facebook over and over again was there were conflicts of interest between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook.<br>
And Facebook, over and over again, chose to optimize for its own interests, like making more money."<br>
haugen is known as a whistleblower and has a book written about her and what she did <br><br>

<p class="solid"</p>Tyler Schultz: was an engineer for theranos which was a company that had no foundationa nd no plan but thanks to the ceo Elizabeth holmes ability to lie her way through life<br>
she managed to net 10 billion and claim to be in production of technology that will not exist for hundreds of years<br><br>

<p class="solid"</p>Cher Scarlett: Scarlett's experiences and observations in a male-dominated occupation led her to become a workers' rights advocate and critic of technology and corporations, she was part of the #appletoo movement<br>
which let workers express mistreatment publicly and was a founder of (apple together) another solidarity group 

<p class="dotted"</p><strong>what is whistleblowing</strong><br><br>Whistleblowing is the act of drawing public attention, or the attention of an authority figure, to perceived wrongdoing, misconduct, unethical activity within public or private workplaces<br>-this is what is well known as internal whistleblowing
<br><br>
when a disgruntled employee files a report to a third party member outside of the organisation this can be even more impacfull than an internal <br>whistleblowing report as this will affect the companys reputation on a much larger scale
as many more people are likely to hear about the report. This is not the biggest threat, the legal issues the company could face can vary depending on the severity of the report <br>- this is external whistleblowing<br><br>
<strong>how does a company protect themselves from whistleblowing </strong><br><br>
All employers should adopt a whistleblowing policy that encourages employees to draw attention to wrongdoing or risky behaviour.<br> In the case of legal action being taken against a company as a result of internal wrongdoing,<br> having and promoting a strong whistleblowing policy may act in part as a legal defence.
