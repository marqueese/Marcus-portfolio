first topic: gamification<br><br>gamification is the way companies or mobile apps will use in app points to allow  the user to claim rewards in order to give them a false sense of accomplishment, they do this by showing a scoring system or a point system
the application of typical elements of game playing (e.g. point scoring, competition with others, rules of play) to other areas of activity, typically as an online marketing technique to encourage engagement with a product or service<br><br>
<strong>companies that use gamification:</strong><br>Microsoft Rewards<br>MCdonalds Monoply<br>Starbucks Rewards<br><br>
All of these companies work with the community to provide them with some of the most popular aspects of their franchise<br>
mcdonalds monoply is a good example, it is a seasonal event that is promoted a lot and brings in the company a lot of money for the company<br>whilst also "rewarding" the customer for buying more and very rarely giving away free prizes, simmilarly to how a game will give you rewards for being a consistent game.
